Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Abstraction: Using an abstract Vehicle class to define a common template.

Inheritance: Car and Motorcycle classes extending the base Vehicle class.

Encapsulation: Using private fields with public getters to protect data.

Basic Java I/O: Reading user input from the console using the Scanner class.

Collections Framework: Using ArrayList to store and manage the list of vehicles.

Control Flow: Using if-else statements and for loops to manage the application's logic.
